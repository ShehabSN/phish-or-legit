			'First of all, the sender\'s email address contains the company name and so does the domain! Unfortunately this is enough to fool some people.

			'Notice how the email is also riddled with grammar and spelling mistakes. Another thing to note is that this email has an impersonal greeting, "Dear Valued Customer". This is quite the red flag, especially for an electricity company demanding payment from their customers.',
			"Lastly, the premise of this email doesn't make much sense. An electricity company would usually send you an invoice by mail. However, if you have a paperless-billing, it would be a good idea to log into the energy company's website and check your invoices (don't click on any links in the email). A good word of advice is to call the company directly using their customer support number and inquire about this bill directly with them.",

			"Lastly, the email seems to have been sent from a legit host name/username (noreply@picturely.ca). While there are ways that attackers can fake this, it is usually a good indicator that the email is legit (although you shouldn't rely solely on this prove an email's legitimacy).",

			'This type of phishing is particularly dangerous since the sender address seems to be completely legit (account@fisco.com). However, attackers can do something called <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_spoofing#Malicious_use_of_spoofing">email spoofing</a> to forge sender addresses. There is an element of negligence on Fisco\'s part for not implementing systems such as SPF, DKIM, and DMARC to protect their customers from email spoofing.',
			'Phishing scams typically try to frighten you by saying something has gone wrong and you need to resolve it by providing your information and doing something. In this case, their account has been "temporarily locked" and they need to click on a link to "get the access back immediatly".',
			'An official email would never include a hyperlink saying, "Please click Here" to perform an important action. Also, that URL definitely does not look like an official domain belonging to Fisco. If you were to click on it, it would probably lead you to a page imitating the official company webpage to get you to give them your information. The best course of action here would be to delete the email and if you\'re still in doubt, contact the support team and inquire about your account status with them.',

Why would a random banker, whose client supposedly died of COVID-19, which is clearly irrelevant and a half-hearted attempt to somehow cause panic by including the name of a common (and current) cause of panic, want to give you a business supposedly worth $5 million? Also note the poor grammar ", Am banker" which is another common sign. Always consider the message, who it\'s from, and whether what its saying could be possible or realistic.',

			"This is a common type of email where you are able to track your order. If you did not make such an order, from the said provider, Best Buy, and your shipment address does not match the listed one, it would be clear that it is a phish. Due to this reason this is unlikely a phish because its very easy for you to identify whether you did place this order or not, so phishers usually would not send such a bad phishing email.",

			"The most obvious reason that this email is a phish is the fact that you are being asked to download and print out an invoice copy. Phishing emails will often ask you to download something which will be bundled with malware. Generally, you are rarely asked by legitimate companies to download things sent through email as in most cases whatever files you need to access can be accessed via your account on their platform. It doesn't help that the attachment itself looks quite shady with generic weird naming and it being a zip file, which is often another red flag.",
			"Despite the sender appearing to come from a legitimate Fedex domain, this still appears somewhat suspicious as a pretty general message such as this would usually not come from a random employee. It could be the employee is attempting to phish people or they were hacked, or it could be the result of spoofing, which is quite rare especially for big companies like Fedex with good security measures.",
			"However, the most important takeaways and signs are that you are being asked to download a zip file and the message doesn't really correspond to Fedex procedures as you are never asked to download a zip file just to print a receipt to bring to their office through email. Before you act on an email, think to yourself does this email really represent what the portrayed sender would ask me to do?",
